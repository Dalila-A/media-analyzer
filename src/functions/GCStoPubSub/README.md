- Function triggered by a PubSub event from upload-notification topic.

- If the format is correct: 
    - The file is moved to the filtered bucket (destination bucket) and deleted from the upload bucket (source bucket)
    - A new message is published to a PubSub topic according to the content type of the file:
        - if video : the message is published in the videointelligenceAPI topic
        - if image : the message is published in the visionAPI topic
